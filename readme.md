# SolScraper

## Intention
Construct a ledger scraper to record, `Genesis Transaction Signature`, `Genesis Time`, and `Mint Price` for an NFT `Mint Address`.

## Code of Conduct
* recording ops need to be seperate from reporting ops.
### Design
#### Recording
Such commandments will usually write (new) data. Never appending, may ammend data.

#### Reporting
Such commandments will never write, append, ammend, any data. *ONLY* reading data.
